Format:
  Indents:
    Two space indent
    case is indented by only one space
    the code inside is indented two spaces from the switch statement
    stuff inside DEBUGR is indented if more than one line
  Spaces:
    if( not if (
    for(i=0;i<5;i++){
    ){ not ) {
    function arguments are f(x, y) or f(x,y) not f( x, y )
    equals signs may have either 0 or 1 space on both sides
    the two sides must be the same
  
  pointer casts are (char*)x
  pointer type is int *px;
  no empty lines at beginning or end of blocks

  Comments:
    commented code has no space after the //
    normal comments have a space after the //
    normal multiline comments are like
    /*
     * Name: RbCaVi
     * Date: today
     */
    multiline commented code has no stars at the start of lines

  Includes:
    include "shared.h++"
    then builtin headers
    library headers
    project headers
    code files (c or c++)

  Classes:
    classes always have an access modifier (public or private) at the start
    the access modifier has no empty lines before it if it's the first line in the class
    otherwise it has one empty line before it


Code:
  each set of code files (c++ and h++, and possibly a few more) has its own set of *_DEBUG symbols
  they are (name of main file, all caps)_DEBUG or (name of main file, all caps)_(subsection)_DEBUG
  all headers must have include guards
  #ifndef (file name)_H
  #define (file name)_H
  (includes)
  (code)
  #endif
  all public classes are defined in an h++ file
